[DEPRECATED]
# BEWARE
This is a deprecated version of my JManager application. The next one will be a WebApp made in Kotlin/Spring and VueJs.
Click on this [link](https://github.com/Sacane/JManager-back) to browse the new back-end part of my application.

# JManager

                                                                     
This is a simple application to manage our personnal incomes or expenses. 
With this you will soon be able to manage what did you buy, how much did it cost, how much money do you have left etc etc...

All of your actions will be displayed as a table, so it will be easy to visualise your expenses and incomes by month.
